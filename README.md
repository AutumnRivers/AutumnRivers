## Autumn Rivers
Hello! My name is Autumn Rivers, and I am a hobbyist programmer. Though I do wish to get into professional programming, I unfortunately don't see that happening soon.
But nevermind that, let's learn more about me!

I prefer making my projects open-source when I can. So I use GitHub quite a bit. Currently working on some Hacknet mods, with original apps coming in the future. Gotta learn Avalonia first...

My pronouns are She/Her, They/Them, and It/Its.

I also go by Nati, Clover, and Estelle!
