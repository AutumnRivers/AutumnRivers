## Autumn Rivers
Hello! My name is Autumn Rivers, and I am a hobbyist programmer. Though I do wish to get into professional programming, I unfortunately don't see that happening soon.
But nevermind that, let's learn more about me!

I'm the founder (and sole member, so far) of [Diamond Grid](https://github.com/diamondgrid), and I prefer making my projects open-source when I can. So I use GitHub quite a bit.

My pronouns are She/Her, They/Them, and any neopronouns.

I also go by Nati!

## Current Projects
- ⚡ **Spark**: Real-time jukebox so you can listen to music with other people. 100% free and open-source!

- ⚙ **Virtual VP** (Working Title): VR reimagining of the Sellbot VP fight from Toontown Online. Stay tuned!
