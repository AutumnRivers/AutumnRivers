## Autumn Rivers
Hello! My name is Autumn Rivers, and I am a hobbyist programmer. Though I do wish to get into professional programming, I unfortunately don't see that happening soon.
But nevermind that, let's learn more about me!

I'm the founder (and sole member, so far) of [Diamond Grid](https://github.com/diamondgrid), and I prefer making my projects open-source when I can. So I use GitHub quite a bit.

My pronouns are She/Her, and Fae/Faer.

You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NatiRivers) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/2w9VTE7).

I also go by Nati and Cheryl!
